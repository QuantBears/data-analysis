- (DONE) Make autoregressive features for all features that are less than .95 correlated on average over a week
- standard scale all features
- Try out all different ML models and hyper-param tune each
	- Check out scikit-learn ParameterGrid for training on all hyperparams
	- For each hyperparam, create validation curve and ensure
		- curve goes up and down such that we know we have both under- and over-tuned each param
- Try out different random states too
- sklearn GridSearchCV
- explainability
	- shap


- Models to try:
	- XGBoost
	- Imputation then linear, random-forest
